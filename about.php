  <h3>Reviews</h3>
  <p>I am a first time home buyer with very little knowledge about the housing market and things to look out for. Traci was very helpful and made the process 10x easier for me. Definitely would recommend going to her. - Giselle Gomez (03/13/2024)</p>
  <p>Traci was extremely helpful with getting us scheduled for a private tour and making sure we were making informed decisions and had information that we might not have known if she hadn't told us. Traci had our backs throughout the process and even after we closed on our home to make sure we were covered. Thank you for all your help and following up! - Carol Falk (05/15/2023)</p>
  <p>Traci was patient, resourceful, and committed to helping me reach my goals. Selling a family home is an emotional and daunting task. However, Traci made the process easier by going above and beyond to stay on track. I can confidently recommend her to anyone looking for a professional and knowledgeable realtor that strives to get the job done! - anbe001 (07/15/2023)</p>
  <p>She was amazing right from the start. Had 0 experience with what I was doing and just wanted to get my feet wet. She explained everything clearly, and multiple times if needed. She also mentioned anything extra that I may not have thought about at first. She also helped with giving an edge in negotiating terms with the offer. It was a random chance to be working with her, just trying to take a look at a random house. But for a process that could have been quite a headache was made extremely smooth. - delrankim (02/1/2023)</p>
  <p>If there was a better word than AMAZING I would use it. Traci is knowledgeable, thorough and she really works in the best interest of her clients regardless of what that might mean for her pockets. She listened to what I wanted and provided suggestions on how to get my house sold and a rather difficult time. Her expertise and care got me through a nerve wrecking time and I am so happy I chose her!!!! You will not be disappointed. - jaweiac (01/30/2023)</p>
  <p>I had an amazing experience with Traci during my process of purchasing my home. She is very professional and has a great team working with her. She was on top of everything from beginning to end. She worked around my busy schedule and made the deal go smoothly. i highly recommend Traci if you think of buying or refinance a home. - GigiLEBRUN (08/4/2022)</p>
  <p>Traci gets 5 stars all around. She's a very hard worker and gets back to you when you call. Always constantly updates you about what you need to do to close on time. Don't know what we would have done if she wasn't our agent. She keeps the clients, lenders and attorneys in the loop. - loving alfred60 (04/28/2022)</p>
  <p>My whole interaction with Ms.Lassiter was amazing her care and continually updating me on my home purchase was comforting and a smooth process.......Thank you for your detail in handling my purchase with professionalism. - troy6937 (01/5/2022)</p>
